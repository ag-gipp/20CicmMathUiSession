_Bertinoro, Italy between July 26 - 31, 2020_

**please redistribute**

## Scope
MathUI is an international workshop to discuss how users can be best supported when doing/learning/searching for/interacting with mathematics using a computer.

* Is mathematical user interface design a design for representing mathematics, embedding mathematical context, or a specific design for mathematicians? 
* How is mathematics for which purpose best represented? 
* What specifically math-oriented support is needed? 
* Does learning of math require a platform different than other learning platforms? 
* Which mathematical services can be offered? 
* Which services can be meaningfully combined? 
* What best practices wrt. mathematics can be found and how can they be best communicated?

We invite all questions, that care for the use of mathematics on computers and how the user experience can be improved, to be 
discussed in the workshop.

## Topics
include

  - user-requirements for math interfaces
  - novel mathematical interfaces
  - presentation formats
  - mobile-devices powered mathematics
  - cultural differences in practices of mathematical languages
  - didactically sensible scenarios of use
  - spreadsheets as mathematical interfaces
  - manipulations of mathematical expressions
  - usability studies of mathematical interfaces 


This workshop follows a successful series of workshops held at the Conferences on Intelligent Computer Mathematics since 11 years; it features presentations of brand new ideas in papers selected by  a thorough review process, wide space for discussions, as well as a software demonstration session.

## Submissions
The organizers invite authors to submit contributions of 6 to 12 pages on the workshop-related topics in PDF format  optionally illustrated by supplementary media such as video recordings or access to demos. Please submit via [easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm13).

## Deadlines
The deadline for submissions is April 15th 2020.
Method of submission: please login and submit via EasyChair.

The submissions will be reviewed by the international programme committee whose comments and recommendations will be sent back by June 21th requesting a final version (6 - 12 pages) no later than June 28th.

Moreover, MathUI will be concluded by an EXPO-like
**demonstration session**. Proposed demonstrations should be sent  by email until June 21th, containing a URL to a software description, a title, a short abstract of the demonstrated
features, and the indication of hardware expectations  (own/lent laptop/tablet, internet access (speed?), power, ...). 

After a short elevator pitch, the demonstration session will  run for 1-3h, each demonstrating to interested parties.
